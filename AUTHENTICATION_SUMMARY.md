  - Centralized auth state management
  - Multiple authentication hooks for different use cases
  - Guest mode state management
  - Database sync status tracking

- **Custom Hooks**
  - `useAuthSync`: Handles Clerk ‚Üî Database synchronization
  - `useAuthState`: Combined authentication state

  - `useGuestMode`: Guest mode functionality

### 4. Guest Mode Implementation
- **Seamless Guest Experience**
  - App works fully without authentication
  - Local storage for guest users
  - Option to upgrade to authenticated account
  - Progress preservation during sign-up
  - Clear messaging about sync limitations

### 5. App Integration
- **Layout Integration** (`/app/_layout.tsx`)
  - AuthProvider wrapped around entire app
  - Conditional Clerk provider based on API key availability
  - iOS Simulator-safe token caching

- **Home Screen Updates** (`/app/index.tsx`)
  - Dynamic welcome messages based on auth state
  - Conditional UI elements (profile vs sign-in buttons)
  - Loading states during auth initialization
  - Guest mode activation

### 6. Type Safety & Models
- **Comprehensive Types** (`/src/lib/storage/models.ts`)
  - Database entity types
  - Authentication state types
  - Validation schemas and helpers
  - Error handling types
  - API response types

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **First App Launch**
   - Initialize database
   - Check for existing Clerk session
   - Load user from database if authenticated
   - Fall back to guest mode if no authentication

2. **Sign-Up Process**
   - User enters details and creates Clerk account
   - Email verification required
   - Upon verification, user is created in local database
   - Preferences initialized with defaults
   - Session established

3. **Sign-In Process**
   - User enters credentials
   - Clerk handles authentication
   - App syncs user data from database
   - Loads user preferences and progress
   - Session restored

4. **Guest Mode**
   - No authentication required
   - Local storage used for bookmarks and progress
   - Clear messaging about sync limitations
   - Easy upgrade path to authenticated account

### Database Synchronization
- **Automatic Sync**: Clerk user creation triggers database user creation
- **Preference Sync**: User preferences stored and synced across devices
- **Progress Tracking**: Reading progress tied to authenticated users
- **Fallback Handling**: Web storage fallback for unsupported platforms

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Error Handling

### Security Features
- Secure token storage with iOS Simulator compatibility
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error boundaries and graceful failure handling
- Proper session management

### Error Handling
- Network failure resilience
- Database error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging

## üéØ User Experience Features

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Loading states throughout auth flows
- Clear error messaging
- Intuitive navigation between auth screens
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Islamic-themed styling consistent with app

### Accessibility
- Proper form labels and hints
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast error states

## üìù Configuration Required

To fully activate authentication:
1. **Set up Clerk Account**
   - Create Clerk application
   - Get publishable key
   - Configure in environment variables

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   ```

3. **Database Initialization**
   - Database auto-initializes on first run
   - SQLite for native platforms
   - Web storage fallback for web

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The authentication system is production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Complete user management
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication flows
- ‚úÖ Guest mode support
- ‚úÖ Database integration
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Type safety
- ‚úÖ Responsive UI
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility

The app now provides a seamless authentication experience that allows users to either sign up/in for full functionality or continue as guests with local-only features.
